We studied the temperature of electrical substation on its nodes through a comparison of linear regression decision tree regressor and SVM regression.  
We tried to minimize the RMSE by trying many models, espescially the SVM model. The best result is provided with the decision tree regressor.   
Compared to the linear model, the SVM regressor is slightly better.
